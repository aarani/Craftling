# craftling-go

The control plane **and** host agent for a multi-host, Firecracker-microVM
Minecraft hosting platform. A [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) HTTP API
owns users, auth, and game-server desired state; a reconciler drives each server
onto a fleet host; and a per-host **agent** boots it as a real Firecracker
microVM. See [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md) for the phased roadmap (P0–P4 landed;
P6 networking in progress).

## Requirements

- Go 1.26+
- PostgreSQL 13+
- For the real VM backend (`AGENT_RUNTIME=firecracker`): a Linux host with
  `/dev/kvm`, the `firecracker` binary, a `vmlinux` kernel, and rootfs images.
- For (re)building the eBPF dataplane: clang + libbpf + bpftool on a Linux ≥6.6
  host (see [docs/ebpf-nat-dataplane.md](docs/ebpf-nat-dataplane.md)).

## Getting started

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # set DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, etc.

# Spin up Postgres (example via Docker):
docker run -d --name craftling-pg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=craftling -p 5432:5432 postgres:16-alpine

make run               # or: go run ./cmd/server
```

The server listens on `:8080` by default and applies the embedded **goose
migrations** (`internal/db/migrations`) automatically on startup — clean on both
a fresh database and one already at an older revision.

## Configuration

`AGENT_ID`, `AGENT_HOSTNAME`, `ZONE`, `CPUS_TOTAL`, `MEMORY_MB_TOTAL`, and
`AGENT_VERSION` further describe the host in its registration.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path                     | Auth   | Description                          |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ------ | ----------------------------------- |

| PATCH  | `/api/v1/servers/:id`    | Bearer | Rename, or set `desired_state` (running/stopped) |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/servers/:id`    | Bearer | Tear down a server (`202`)          |
| GET    | `/api/v1/templates`      | Bearer | List marketplace templates          |

| POST   | `/api/v1/agent/hosts/:id/heartbeat` | Agent | Host liveness + capacity heartbeat |

Auth endpoints return a token pair:

```json
{
  "access_token": "<jwt>",
  "refresh_token": "<opaque>",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 900
}
```

The short-lived **access token** is sent as `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
on protected routes. When it expires, exchange the **refresh token** at
`/auth/refresh` for a new pair. Refresh tokens are **rotated** on every use
(the old one is revoked); replaying a rotated token is treated as theft and
revokes all of that user's tokens.

```bash
# Register (or login) to get a token pair
PAIR=$(curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"alice@example.com","password":"hunter2pass"}')
ACCESS=$(echo "$PAIR" | jq -r .access_token)
REFRESH=$(echo "$PAIR" | jq -r .refresh_token)

# Call a protected route
curl localhost:8080/api/v1/me -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS"

# Later: rotate for a fresh pair
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/refresh \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"refresh_token\":\"$REFRESH\"}"

# Log out (revoke the refresh token)
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/logout \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"refresh_token\":\"$REFRESH\"}"
```

### Roles

Each user has a single role (`user` by default, or `admin`). The role is
embedded in the access-token claims, and `RequireRole` middleware guards
admin routes — so authorization is checked without a database round-trip.

Because the role lives in the JWT, a role change takes effect on the user's
next token refresh (within `ACCESS_TTL`), not instantly.

Set `ADMIN_EMAIL` + `ADMIN_PASSWORD` to bootstrap an admin on startup: a
matching user is created if absent, or promoted to `admin` if it already
exists (its password is left untouched).

## Game servers & the reconciler

A game server separates **desired state** (`running` / `stopped` / `deleted`,
set by the API) from **observed status** (`pending` → `provisioning` →
`running` → `stopping` → `stopped` → `deleting`, plus `error`). A background
**reconciler** (`internal/reconciler`) ticks periodically, finds servers whose
status doesn't match their desired state, and drives them one step at a time
via a `Provisioner` backend.

**Placement (P2).** Before a server can run it must be placed on a fleet host.
The `internal/scheduler` picks a `ready` host with enough allocatable cpu/memory
(least-loaded) and **atomically reserves** that capacity; the assignment is
recorded as `game_servers.host_id`. A server that fits no host right now is
marked `unschedulable` and retried; a spec larger than any host is rejected at
create time.

**Agent split (P3).** The control plane never touches KVM. The reconciler's
backend is `provisioner.RemoteProvisioner`, which resolves the assigned host's
address and calls that host's **agent** (`cmd/agent` / `internal/agent`) over
HTTP to provision/start/stop/deprovision the VM. The agent runs a `Runtime`;
which one is chosen by `AGENT_RUNTIME` (`fake` for the in-memory stub, or
`firecracker` for real microVMs) — the API and reconciler are identical either
way because both satisfy the same `agent.Runtime` interface. Agents register and
heartbeat with the control plane so the scheduler knows the fleet.

```bash
# Create a server (desired_state defaults to running)
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/api/v1/servers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"survival","version":"1.20.4"}'

# Poll until the reconciler reports status "running" with host/port
curl -s localhost:8080/api/v1/servers/<id> -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS"

# Stop / start
curl -s -X PATCH localhost:8080/api/v1/servers/<id> \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"desired_state":"stopped"}'

# Tear down (reconciler deprovisions, then soft-deletes the row)
curl -s -X DELETE localhost:8080/api/v1/servers/<id> -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS"
```

Deletes are **soft**: the reconciler deprovisions the VM and then sets
`status = deleted` with a `deleted_at` timestamp. The row is retained for
history/audit but hidden from every API read (and from reconciliation).

## Firecracker runtime, the image pipeline & networking

**Runtime (P4).** `internal/agent/firecracker` boots each server as a real
Firecracker microVM, driving Firecracker through the in-repo generated REST
client (`internal/firecracker`) over the per-VM API Unix socket and managing the
VMM process directly. `Provision` stages a per-VM writable copy of the version's
base rootfs, launches `firecracker`, configures machine/boot-source/drive, then
starts the instance; `Stop` sends `SendCtrlAltDel` (force-kill after a grace
period) **but keeps the rootfs** so the world survives a restart on that host;
`Start` re-boots from it. `make test-kvm` runs the gated lifecycle integration
test on a `/dev/kvm` host.

**Image pipeline.** `internal/image` converts an OCI/Docker image into a
read-only **squashfs** rootfs (`internal/squashfs`), injecting the Go init binary
(`cmd/init`) as PID 1. The init agent mounts the kernel filesystems, fetches a
**run spec** (`internal/runspec`) from Firecracker's MMDS over the link-local
address, applies per-VM networking, then execs and supervises the workload —
powering the VM off when it exits. The control plane resolves launchable
templates from a marketplace registry (`internal/registry`, the `/templates`
API).

**Networking (P6, in progress).** An eBPF NAT dataplane gives each VM real
connectivity with no Linux bridge and no iptables/nftables rules: TCX-attached
programs SNAT egress and DNAT a per-server host port to the in-VM service port,
reusing the kernel's `nf_conntrack` via `bpf_ct_*` kfuncs. The guest applies its
address, gateway neighbor, and default route from the run spec. Design and
current status: [docs/ebpf-nat-dataplane.md](docs/ebpf-nat-dataplane.md).

## Layout

```
cmd/server          control-plane entry point: DB connect/migrate + HTTP API + graceful shutdown
cmd/agent           host-agent entry point: VM API + register/heartbeat; selects the VM backend

internal/config     environment configuration (control plane + agent + Firecracker)
internal/db         pgx pool + embedded goose migrations
internal/model      domain types (User, GameServer, Host)

internal/auth       bcrypt password hashing + JWT issue/verify
internal/handler    control-plane routes (auth, servers, templates, admin, agent)
internal/middleware request ID, request logging, JWT/agent auth guards
internal/registry   template registry (marketplace) client

internal/firecracker generated Firecracker REST client (go-openapi, over the API Unix socket)
internal/image      OCI/Docker image → squashfs rootfs converter (injects cmd/init)

```

## Commands

```bash
make run          # run the control plane
make run-agent    # run a host agent (MODE=agent; see Makefile/.env.example for env)
make build        # build control plane to ./bin/server
make build-agent  # build agent to ./bin/agent
make test         # run unit tests
make test-e2e     # run end-to-end tests (requires Docker)
make test-kvm     # Firecracker lifecycle test (requires /dev/kvm + host artifacts)
make bpf-generate # regenerate eBPF bindings/objects (Linux ≥6.6 + clang/libbpf/bpftool)
make tidy         # tidy go.mod
make fmt          # format code
```

## Testing

End-to-end tests live in `test/e2e/`. They are gated behind the `e2e` build
tag, so `make test` (plain `go test ./...`) never touches Docker. The e2e
suite uses [testcontainers](https://golang.testcontainers.org/) to start a
real Postgres, serves the actual router over HTTP, and drives the full
lifecycle (register → login → server placement → reconcile → teardown):

```bash
make test-e2e          # or: go test -tags e2e ./test/e2e/...
```

The Firecracker lifecycle test is gated behind the `kvm` build tag and kept out
of the default lane; run it on a KVM host with the `FC_*` artifacts in place:

```bash
FC_KERNEL=... FC_IMAGE_DIR=... FC_DEFAULT_IMAGE=base.ext4 make test-kvm
```
