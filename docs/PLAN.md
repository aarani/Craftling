# Craftling — Platform Roadmap

## Context

`craftling-go` today is a **control plane**: auth (JWT + rotating refresh tokens), roles, owner-scoped game-server CRUD, a desired-state/observed-status **reconciler**, and a `Provisioner` interface whose only implementation is `Fake` (returns `127.0.0.1:25565`, no-op teardown).

The goal is a **multi-host, Firecracker-microVM Minecraft hosting platform** with durable world storage. Decisions driving this roadmap: **Firecracker** microVMs · **multi-host fleet** from the start · **object/network storage** for world data · **full roadmap** to production.

This document is the phased plan to get there. Each milestone lists its goal, why it lands in that order, the concrete steps (anchored to existing code), the new components, and how it's verified.

## Guiding principles / invariants (hold across all phases)

- **Reconciliation is the core loop** — `desired_state` vs observed `status`; the reconciler is the *sole writer of compute side effects*.
- **`Provisioner` is the backend seam** — new compute backends slot in behind it without touching the API.
- **The control plane never touches KVM** — only the host agent does.
- **Owner-scoped, admin-visible, no-leak** — keep the `ownedOr404` pattern; admins get fleet-wide views.
- **Soft deletes / audit retained.**
- **Additive, idempotent schema changes** until P0 swaps in a real migration tool.

## Done so far (foundation)

Auth + refresh rotation + roles; `game_servers` CRUD + admin fleet-view; reconciler (2s) + token reaper; `Provisioner` interface with `Fake`; e2e suite (testcontainers) + CI; multi-stage Dockerfile.

**P0 done:** goose migrations (`internal/db/migrations`, applied on startup, clean on fresh + pre-existing DBs); `Provisioner` extended with `Start`/`Stop`/`Status` (stopped ≠ destroyed); `Mode` (`server`/`agent`) in `internal/config`.

**P2 done:** `internal/scheduler` — least-loaded placement over the in-memory fleet with **atomic capacity reservation** (`HostRepository.Reserve`/`Release` under the existing lock; `Reserve` is the race-safe commit point, the scheduler picks from a snapshot but only a host that still fits accepts). `game_servers.host_id` (migration `00002`, nullable, **no FK** — referential integrity is the scheduler's job). The reconciler places a `running`-desired, unassigned server before booting its VM; if nothing fits it marks the server `unschedulable` (a new status) and retries next tick; on delete it releases the host capacity. `host_id` persists across stop/start (the VM stays put) and is cleared only on delete. Create-time validation rejects a spec larger than any host's *total* capacity (`Scheduler.CanEverFit`; with no hosts yet it permits creation to wait). Identity reservations are reset to total on a control-plane restart (in-memory fleet) — a known limitation until a durable inventory lands. e2e covers placement (server reaches `running` with a `host_id`, host allocatable reduced) + oversize → `400`; scheduler unit tests cover spread, capacity/memory bounds, down-host exclusion, release, and concurrent reservation atomicity.

**P1 done:** `model.Host` + **in-memory** `HostRepository` (`internal/repository/host.go`, concurrency-safe map — no durable table yet); agent endpoints `POST /api/v1/agent/hosts/register` + `POST /api/v1/agent/hosts/:id/heartbeat` behind a placeholder `middleware.AgentAuth` seam; admin fleet view `GET /api/v1/admin/hosts`; host reaper (`reaper.Hosts`, 30s TTL / 10s sweep) marks stale hosts `down`, heartbeat recovers them to `ready`. **Identity is agent-owned**, not control-plane-assigned: register accepts an optional agent-supplied `id` (authoritative key on upsert), so a host keeps its id across a control-plane restart even though the fleet lives only in memory — this is why no `hosts` table is needed yet. e2e covers register → heartbeat → stale → `down` → recover, plus agent-supplied-id stability.

## P0 — Foundations (no behavior change)

- **Goal:** prepare the codebase for distributed growth before adding it.
- **Why first:** schema and interfaces churn a lot next; do the boring groundwork once.
- **Steps:**
  - Adopt a migration tool (`golang-migrate` or `goose`). Convert `internal/db/schema.sql` into ordered migration files; replace the embedded-exec in `internal/db/db.go` `Migrate()`. Keep apply-on-startup.
  - Extend `provisioner.Provisioner` with `Start`/`Stop`/`Status` (so *stopped* ≠ *destroyed*); update `Fake` and `internal/reconciler` accordingly.
  - Add a `Mode`/`Role` to `internal/config` (`server` vs `agent`) ahead of the P3 binary split.
- **New code:** `internal/db/migrations/*.sql`; migration runner.
- **Verify:** existing e2e stays green; migrations apply cleanly on both fresh and pre-existing DBs.

## P1 — Host fleet ✅

- **Goal:** model the pool of worker hosts.
- **Why:** scheduling and every compute action target a host; need an inventory + liveness first.
- **Steps:**
  - ~~`hosts` table~~ → **in-memory `HostRepository`** holding the same fields (`id, hostname, address, zone, cpus_total, memory_mb_total, cpus_allocatable, memory_mb_allocatable, status (ready|draining|down), agent_version, last_heartbeat_at, timestamps`). The fleet is reconstructable from live heartbeats, so no durable table is required at this phase; the repo's method set is DB-shaped so a Postgres store can slot in later unchanged.
  - `internal/repository/host.go` (`HostRepository`): upsert-register, heartbeat, get, list, list-ready (capacity-query seam for P2), mark-stale.
  - Agent-facing endpoints: `POST /api/v1/agent/hosts/register`, `POST /api/v1/agent/hosts/:id/heartbeat` (agent auth is a placeholder now; hardened in P10).
  - Host reaper (reuse `internal/reaper` pattern): mark hosts `down` when heartbeat goes stale; a later heartbeat recovers a host to `ready`.
  - **Identity (decision):** *agent-owned ids* — register accepts an optional agent-supplied `id`, the authoritative upsert key. A host keeps its id across a control-plane restart (the agent re-registers with the same id), so future `game_servers.host_id` references survive restarts without persisting the fleet. A durable `hosts` table is only needed later if we want declarative inventory (remembering a host that is `down` *and* silent).
  - **Comms model (decision):** *control-plane-authoritative hybrid* — agents push status up via heartbeat; the control plane enacts desired state by calling **down** to agents (P3).
- **New code:** `model.Host`, in-memory `HostRepository`, agent host handlers, `middleware.AgentAuth` placeholder, host reaper, admin `GET /api/v1/admin/hosts`.
- **Verify:** e2e — register host → heartbeat → stale → `down` → recover; agent-supplied-id stability. ✅

## P2 — Scheduler / placement ✅

- **Goal:** assign each unplaced server to a host with capacity.
- **Steps:**
  - ✅ Add `host_id` to `game_servers` (nullable; a plain id column, **not** a DB FK while the fleet is in-memory — referential integrity is the scheduler's job); add an `unschedulable` signal (status + `status_message`). Relies on P1's agent-owned ids staying stable across restarts.
  - ✅ `internal/scheduler`: pick a `ready` host with enough allocatable cpu/mem (least-loaded/first-fit); **reserve capacity atomically** — the in-memory fleet has no DB transaction, so the reservation commits under `HostRepository`'s lock (`Reserve`), and the scheduler treats a lost race as "try the next candidate".
  - ✅ Reconciler: if a `running`-desired server has no `host_id`, call the scheduler; if nothing fits, mark `unschedulable` and retry next tick. Capacity is released on delete.
  - ✅ Create-time validation: reject specs larger than any host can ever fit (`CanEverFit`), allowing creation when the fleet is still empty.
- **New code:** `internal/scheduler`; `host_id` column (migration `00002`); `HostRepository.Reserve`/`Release`.
- **Verify:** ✅ scheduler unit tests (spread, capacity/memory bounds, down-host exclusion, release, concurrent reservation) + e2e (placement reaches `running` with `host_id` and reduced host allocatable; oversize → `400`).

## P3 — Agent split (control plane ↔ host agent)

- **Goal:** move VM execution off the control-plane process onto the host.
- **Why:** the control plane must not run KVM; today the reconciler calls `Provisioner` in-process.
- **Steps:**
  - New binary `cmd/agent` + `internal/agent` with a `Runtime` interface (ship `FakeRuntime` first) and an agent API (gRPC or REST): provision/start/stop/deprovision/status of local VMs.
  - `internal/provisioner`: add `RemoteProvisioner` implementing `Provisioner` by calling the assigned host's agent API (address resolved from `hosts` via `host_id`). The reconciler's call *shape* is unchanged — it just becomes a network hop.
  - Agent registers + heartbeats (P1) and reports per-VM observed status, which reconciles into `game_servers.status`.
- **New code:** `cmd/agent`, `internal/agent` (`Runtime`, `FakeRuntime`, agent server), `provisioner.RemoteProvisioner`.
- **Verify:** e2e runs control plane + an in-process `FakeRuntime` agent; full lifecycle across the network seam.

## P4 — Firecracker runtime

- **Goal:** real microVMs on the agent.
- **Steps:**
  - `internal/agent/firecracker`: `Runtime` driver via `firecracker-go-sdk` + jailer — boot with `vmlinux` kernel + rootfs, vCPU/mem from spec, manage API socket, lifecycle (boot/pause/resume/stop/destroy).
  - Minecraft rootfs image: minimal Linux + JRE + server jar (by version) + EULA accept + RCON enabled + an init that pulls the world (P5) and launches the server. Versioned image-build pipeline (`build/firecracker`, `scripts/`, Make target).
  - Kernel image management.
- **New code:** `internal/agent/firecracker`; image-build scripts; per-version rootfs.
- **Verify:** KVM-gated integration test behind a new `kvm` build tag on a `/dev/kvm` host; manual: connect a Minecraft client. Keep this out of the default CI lane.

## P5 — World persistence (object/network storage)

- **Goal:** durable world data; precondition for safe rescheduling between hosts.
- **Steps:**
  - `internal/storage`: `WorldStore` interface (`Put`/`Get`/`Exists`) with an S3-compatible impl (and/or NFS mount); per-server world key.
  - Agent: pull world archive into the VM data disk before launch; on stop / periodically, RCON `save-all` + flush, archive, upload.
  - Reschedule: because the world lives in the store, deprovision on host A → provision on host B is safe.
- **New code:** `internal/storage` (`WorldStore`, S3 impl); snapshot logic in agent.
- **Verify:** stop on host A, force-start on host B, world intact; e2e with a MinIO testcontainer.

## P6 — Networking / player access

- **Goal:** players can actually connect.
- **Steps:**
  - Agent: per-VM tap device + IP; host NAT.
  - Port allocation: per-server port on the host's public IP (a `ports` table or host-local range); DNAT `host:port → vm:25565`; write `host`/`port` back to `game_servers` (columns already exist).
  - Future path: per-server hostname via a TCP/SNI proxy.
- **New code:** agent networking; port allocation.
- **Verify:** connect a client to `host_public_ip:allocated_port`.

## P7 — Observability / deep health

- **Goal:** know the *Minecraft process* is up, not just the VM.
- **Steps:**
  - Agent probes via RCON / Server List Ping: up?, player count, MOTD → report to control plane (`player_count`, `health`, `last_seen` on `game_servers` or a `server_health` table).
  - Prometheus `/metrics` on control plane + agent; log shipping hooks (zap already structured); surface `status_message`/health in API responses.
- **Verify:** e2e asserts health transitions; scrape `/metrics`.

## P8 — Reliability

- **Goal:** survive reconcile and host failures.
- **Steps:**
  - Reconciler retry/backoff: replace one-shot `status=error` with `attempts` + `next_attempt_at` (exponential backoff); `ListReconcilable` respects backoff.
  - Host failure: reaper marks host `down` → reschedule its servers (clear `host_id`) with **fencing** (generation token / ensure old VM gone) to avoid split-brain.
  - Draining: `draining` host → no new placement, migrate servers off.
  - Optional leader election (advisory lock/lease) if running multiple control-plane replicas.
- **Verify:** kill a host in test → servers rescheduled; error path retries with backoff.

## P9 — Quotas / resource controls

- **Goal:** bound per-user usage.
- **Steps:** `user_quotas` table (`max_servers`, `max_cpus`, `max_memory_mb`); enforce in Create/Update against current usage; admin endpoints to view/set.
- **Verify:** e2e — exceed quota → `403`.

## P10 — Hardening & ops

- **Goal:** production readiness.
- **Steps:**
  - Agent↔control-plane auth: per-host tokens or mTLS with rotation; lock down `/api/v1/agent/*`.
  - Secrets management: JWT/DB/object-storage creds from env/secret store; **fail fast** if `JWT_SECRET` is the default in production.
  - microVM isolation review (jailer, seccomp, cgroups, network policy).
  - Deploy split: control plane (static image, HA behind LB) vs agent (systemd on KVM hosts, needs `/dev/kvm`); config per role.
  - CI: keep the default Docker-only lane fast; add a self-hosted **KVM lane** for `kvm`-tagged tests; wire the image-build pipeline.
- **Verify:** security review; staged rollout.

## Dependency order

`P0 → P1 → P2 → P3 → P4` (compute path); `P5` after P3 (needs agent) and gates safe reschedule in `P8`; `P6` after P4; `P7`/`P9` after P3; `P8` after P2+P5; `P10` last, cross-cutting.
